      <h1>D3.js Chart Gallery</h1>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This site covers various charts using D3.js. It is an attempt to highlight how different charts work and demonstrate
        their applicable uses. The data used in various charts are a mix of real and imaginary data. The goal is to showcase how 
        each chart can provide a strong visualization depending on the dataset and purpose. In general, all data concerns journalism 
        institutes, with The New York Times often being the primary source.
      </p>
      <h3>Using The Site</h3>
      <p>You can navigate through 18 different charts through the side navigation bar. Each chart will present a different visualization,
        a small snippet of what it is visualizing, what the chart is and its most applicable use cases, and identifying the Marks and Channels
        that make up the visualization.
      </p>
      <h3>Development Process</h3>
      <p>These 18 charts were developed over the course of 3 weeks. The idea was to get an understanding
        of popular charts for data visualizations and analyze when to use which chart for which dataset, leading to an appropriate and
        well done visualization. It was entirely developed with D3.js v5. 
      </p>
      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>Throughout the process of learning and developing these 18 charts, I utilized a variety of resources.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Travis Stodter and the Data Visualization Class</li>
        <li>Numerous Mike Bostock Examples</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/d3/d3">D3's Documentation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/">D3.js Graph Gallery</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Overall while developing the charts was a great exercise, I did come across some challenges. Some came in the form of
        the charts themselves: the chord and candlestick were two particularly tough visualizations to nail down. Other challenges 
        came in the form of thinking of how to design a create a certain graph or creating imaginary data for the purpose of the visualization.
        Some charts were harder to think of how to make visually appealing (such as the Partition chart). Some data being imaginary means that while it
        may lend itself to displaying the use of the visualization, it does not hold real-world significance in the message it's trying to send. Despite
        some of these challenges, the development of the 18 charts was an overall positive learning experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Future Work</h3>
      <p>In the future, should I decide to revisit this project I'd like to accomplish a few of the following things.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve the styling of some graphs (looking at you Partition), and the menu.</li>
        <li>Implement more options for interactivity across the board.</li>
        <li>Design and insert a Sunburt graph.</li>
        <li>Implement responsive design standards.</li>
        <li>Switch entirely over to real data for all charts.</li>
      </ul>
